Trees Series:  

- Binary Tree: At max 2 nodes (0 || 1 || 2 child nodes)
- Types: 
   - Full Binary Tree (0 || 2 child nodes)
   - Complete Binary Tree
       - all the levels should be completely filled with 2 child nodes
       - the last level can have less than 2 nodes but should be as left as possible
   - Perfect Binary Tree (leaf nodes should be at same level)
   - Balanced Binary Tree (height of tree at max log(n) base 2 where n= no of nodes)
   - Degenerate Tree (queue kinda tree where nodes are lined up as queue lines)
